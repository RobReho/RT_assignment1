\begin{quote}
The package controls a holonomic robot in 2D space by assigning random coordinates and the proper linear velocity to reach them. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Service node}

The service node {\ttfamily /target\+\_\+service} creates the service server {\ttfamily /target} that provides random x and y coordinates. It relies on a custom service message {\ttfamily motion\+\_\+controller/\+Random}.

\subsection*{Random service}

Custom service /\+Random requests {\ttfamily float32 min} and {\ttfamily float32 max} interval values and responds with {\ttfamily float32 x} and {\ttfamily float32 y}.

\subsection*{Controller node}

The node {\ttfamily /motion\+\_\+controller} is subscribed to {\ttfamily /odom} topic, which publishes the robot\textquotesingle{}s current coordinates. The callback function compares these coordinates to the random assigned target and calls the service server {\ttfamily /target} to get a new target if the difference is below a threshold of 0.\+1, otherwise the appropriate linear velocities for x and y are calculated and in turn published to the topic {\ttfamily /cmd\+\_\+vel}.

\subsection*{How to run}

download this folder in your working space\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone kghyfnytfn
\end{DoxyCode}
 build it with {\ttfamily catkin\+\_\+make}, then run the following nodes\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun stage\_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/wor/exercise.world
2 rosrun motion\_controller target\_service 
3 rosrun motion\_controller motion\_controller 
\end{DoxyCode}
